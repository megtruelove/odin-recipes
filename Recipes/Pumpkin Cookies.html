    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These pumpkin chocolate chip cookies are thin & chewy and they're dappled with melty puddles of chocolate! Made in under 30 minutes with no chilling time needed.</p>
    <p>If you want to make the cookie dough in advance, you can definitely do that. Just note that the texture will be slightly different than if the cookies are baked immediately because the butter has a chance to resolidify in the fridge. Add 1-2 minutes to the baking timer if using chilled dough.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3/4 cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 1/2 ounces baking chocolate</li>
        <li>3/4 cup dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/3 pumpkin puree</li>
        <li>1 large egg yolk</li>
        <li>2 1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice</li>
        <li>1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350F. Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Start by melting the butter on the stove-top. Slice the butter then add it to a medium pot over medium heat. Once melted, remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Roughly chop the baking chocolate into a variety of sizes and set aside.</li>
        <li>For cookies with melted chocolate throughout, use the pot with the melted butter to make the cookie dough. For cookies with less melted chocolate, transfer the melted butter to a new mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>To the melted butter, add the brown sugar, granulated sugar, and pumpkin puree. Stir until well combined. Whisk in egg yolk, stirring continuously until evenly distributed.</li>
        <li>In a seperate bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and pumpkin pie spice. Add half of this mixture to the wet ingredients, stirring until well combined. Stir in the remaining flour mixture.</li>
        <li>Fold in the chocolate chips and chopped chocolate. The more the dough is stirred, the more the chocolate will melt and distribute throughout the dough.</li>
        <li>Use a 1-ounce cookie scoop to portion cookie dough on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Leave 3 inches between cookies.</li>
        <li>Bake at 350F for 9-11 minutes, or until edges of cookies are set. Remove from the oven and sprinkle with flakey sea salt. Transfer to wire cooling rack once firm enough to handle. Enjoy!</li>
