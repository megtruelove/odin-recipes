    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>An ode to fall (as well to its briskness and efficiency), this easy dinner starts with a sheet pan of my favorite things to eat—guanciale (Italian cured pork jowl, the O.G. in authentic carbonara); sweet, caramelized butternut squash; and dark, iron-heavy Tuscan kale—which all get tossed into cooked orecchiette and grated over with salty Pecorino.</p>
    <p>his pasta makes enough for two servings (and if you look at the finished dish closely enough, you'll notice that it has the same colors as my sweater). If there are two of you, then good for you! But if you're like me, happily alone, then pack half of it for lunch.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>4 ounces guanciale (or thick-cut bacon, if you can't find guanciale), cut into 1/2-inch dice</li>
        <li>8 ounces butternut squash, cut into 1/2-inch dice</li>
        <li>1 bunch Tuscan kale, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1/2 pound orecchiette</li>
        <li>Freshly grated Pecorino Romano, to taste</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>While the oven is preheating at 400°F, cut up the guanciale and butternut squash. Toss them onto a sheet pan, drizzle with the olive oil, shmoosh them around a little, and roast for 30 minutes. At this point, take the sheet pan out, stir in the kale, and place back into the oven to roast for another 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, bring a pot of generously salted water to a boil and cook the orecchiette according to the box’s instructions, usually 9 to 11 minutes or al dente. Drain and add back to the pot. Tip the contents of the sheet pan into the pasta pot and toss with the Pecorino Romano. Salt and pepper to taste.</li>
    </ol>
